# TDCOSMO likelihood for Cobaya

This package provides the TDCOSMO likelihood as an external package for [Cobaya](https://cobaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). The hierarchical computation of the likelihood uses the [hierArc](https://hierarc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. An example notebook is included demonstrating how to use this likelihood package with Cobaya.

## Requirements
 * hierArc
 * lenstronomy
 * camb
