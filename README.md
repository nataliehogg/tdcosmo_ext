# TDCOSMO likelihood for Cobaya

This package provides the TDCOSMO likelihood as an external package for [Cobaya](https://cobaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). The hierarchical computation of the likelihood uses the [hierArc](https://hierarc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package along with [lenstronomy](https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). An example notebook is included demonstrating how to use the package.

## Requirements
 * hierArc: clone from [repo](https://github.com/sibirrer/hierArc)
 * lenstronomy >= 1.1.3: install with `pip` or clone from [repo](https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy/tree/main)
